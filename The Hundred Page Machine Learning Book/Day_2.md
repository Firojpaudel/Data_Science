#### Example Case:
**Problem**: Spam Detection.<br>
  *Let's assume we have gathered emails (say 10,000), each with label: **"Spam" and "Not_Spam"***. Now, we have to convert each message into feature vector. Converting messages into feature vector solely depends on Analyst experience.<br>
  Now we have machine-readable input data, but the output's still human-readable. Some learnig algos require transforming labels into numbers. For example: in above case, labels could be <u>**0 : for Not_Spam**</u> and <u>**1: for Spam mails**</u>.<br>
  Now at this point we have dataset and algo, so we are ready to apply algo to the dataset to get model. 


  > **Note:** On Further reading, author uses SVM(Support Vector Machine) algorithm to represent Supervised Learning where <u>+1 : Spam and -1: Not_Spam<u>
