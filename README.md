# Machine Learning & Data Science:
> **Repo details:** *Daily update of my learnings* 

## Day_1: 
Starting to learn **The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book** _By Andry Burkov_ 

> Summary note of what I read today: 

### 1. **What is ML?**
Process of solving practical problem by: 
  - Gathering dataset
  - And algorithmically bulding a statistical model based in dataset.

### Types of Learning: 
   1. Supervised Learning
   2. Unsupervised learning
   3. Semi- supervised Learning 
   4. Reinforcement Learning 

   ### Supervised Learning:
   - In Supervised Learning, _dataset is collection of labeled examples {x,y}._
     - where, x -> feature vector and y -> label

     #### Feature Vector: 
     A vector in which each dimension j = 1,2, ...,D contains the element somehow.
     > Meaning: If x of one dimension say "d" has data related to a particular category then for iterations N, the datas are related to same category. 
   - y -> label :: can be element belonging to finite set _**classes, real number, or complex structures like matrices, vector, tree or graph.**_

   - ##### Goal : 
   To produce a **model** that takes a featured vector x as a input and outputs info that allows deducing the label for this feature vector. 
  

  > **Note**: In Supervised Learning, algo is trained on the dataset that is already "labelled" with correct answers. 
              _Algo learns from these labelled examples_ to generalize patterns and relationships and make _predictions of unseen data._

  ### Unsupervised Learning:
